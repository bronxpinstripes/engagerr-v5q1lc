## WHY - Vision & Purpose

### Purpose & Users

Engagerr is a two-sided marketplace platform that revolutionizes how content creators and brands collaborate through advanced analytics and matchmaking.

- **What does your application do?** Creates a comprehensive platform that provides content creators with sophisticated analytics to track and value their content across platforms while enabling brands to discover and engage with creators for partnerships.

- **Who will use it?** Two primary user types: 1) Content creators (independent creators, podcasters, athletes, celebrities) and 2) Brands seeking partnerships with these creators.

- **Why will they use it instead of alternatives?** Engagerr's proprietary content mapping technology tracks parent/child content relationships and provides holistic analytics across platforms, giving creators unprecedented insights into their total reach and content performance, while brands gain access to data-driven creator discovery with transparent valuation metrics.
