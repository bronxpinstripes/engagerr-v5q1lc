- **recommendation.ts**: Generates personalized recommendations

The system uses both explicit criteria matching and AI-enhanced compatibility scoring.

### Integration Framework

The integration framework in `/src/backend/src/integrations` connects with external platforms:

- **platforms/**: Platform-specific adapters (YouTube, Instagram, etc.)
- **stripe/**: Payment processing integration
- **resend/**: Email service integration

Each platform adapter implements a common interface for authentication, content retrieval, and metrics collection.

### Transaction System

The transaction system in `/src/backend/src/transactions` handles financial operations:

- **payments.ts**: Processes payments between brands and creators
- **escrow.ts**: Manages escrow for milestone-based payments
- **contracts.ts**: Generates and manages legal agreements
- **reconciliation.ts**: Ensures financial consistency

The system integrates with Stripe for payment processing and implements custom escrow logic for creator protection.

## Frontend Architecture

- Custom hooks for domain-specific state
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Server components for data-heavy operations

## Key Features Implementation

### Content Relationship Mapping

The content relationship mapping feature tracks how content evolves across platforms:

1. **Content Detection**: When a creator connects a platform, the system fetches their content via the platform API
2. **Relationship Analysis**: The AI system analyzes content to detect potential relationships
3. **Graph Construction**: The `hierarchyBuilder.ts` creates a hierarchical structure using LTREE
4. **Visualization**: The `ContentFamilyGraph.tsx` component renders the relationships visually

The LTREE implementation allows efficient querying of content families, such as finding all derivatives of a particular piece of content.

### Cross-Platform Analytics

The analytics standardization process creates unified metrics across platforms:

1. **Raw Data Collection**: Platform adapters fetch platform-specific metrics
2. **Standardization**: The `standardization.ts` applies platform-specific transformations
3. **Aggregation**: The `aggregation.ts` combines metrics across content families
4. **Visualization**: The analytics components render the standardized data

The system accounts for platform differences in engagement definitions, audience measurement, and content performance.

### AI-Powered Matching

The creator-brand matching system uses AI to find compatible partnerships:

1. **Criteria Definition**: Brands specify their requirements (audience, performance, etc.)
2. **Initial Filtering**: The `filtering.ts` applies explicit criteria
3. **Compatibility Scoring**: The `matching.ts` calculates AI-enhanced match scores
4. **Ranking**: The `ranking.ts` sorts creators by relevance
5. **Recommendation**: The `recommendation.ts` suggests additional creators

The system balances explicit criteria with AI-detected compatibility factors like content style, audience alignment, and brand values.

### Partnership Workflow

The partnership workflow manages the entire collaboration process:

1. **Discovery**: Brands find creators through search or recommendations
2. **Proposal**: Either party can initiate a partnership proposal
3. **Negotiation**: Parties can accept, decline, or counter proposals
4. **Contract**: The `contracts.ts` generates a legal agreement
5. **Payment**: The `escrow.ts` secures funds during the partnership
6. **Deliverables**: Creators submit content for brand approval
7. **Completion**: Funds are released upon deliverable approval

The system provides transparency and protection for both creators and brands throughout the process.

### Test Coverage

- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Write tests for critical business logic
- Test both success and error paths

### Testing Types

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user flows

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `feature/short-description`: For new features
- `bugfix/issue-description`: For bug fixes
- `hotfix/critical-issue`: For critical production fixes
- `refactor/component-name`: For code refactoring
- `docs/update-area`: For documentation updates

### Commit Message Format

Follow the Conventional Commits specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types include:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect code functionality
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or tooling

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a PR from your forked repository
2. Fill out the PR template with details about your changes
3. Link any related issues
4. Ensure all tests pass and CI checks are green
5. Request reviewers from the core team
6. Address feedback from code reviews
7. Update documentation to reflect your changes
8. Wait for approval before merging

## CI/CD Pipeline

Engagerr uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

### CI Workflow

The CI pipeline includes:
- Linting and type checking
- Unit tests with coverage reporting
- Building the application
- Building AI containers
- Deploying preview environments for PRs
- Running integration tests against preview environments

### Deployment

Deployment to production is handled through Vercel:

1. Merge to main branch triggers a production build
2. Vercel builds and deploys the application
3. Post-deployment verification tests are run

## Documentation

- Update relevant documentation with code changes
- Document complex functions and components
- Use JSDoc format for code documentation
- Update the README.md if necessary

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Database connection issues**: Verify that Supabase is running and credentials are correct
- **Environment configuration problems**: Check that all required environment variables are set
- **AI container startup failures**: Check container logs for errors
- **NextJS build issues**: Verify dependencies and clear the Next.js cache

### Getting Help

- Check the documentation for troubleshooting tips
- Search for similar issues on GitHub
- Reach out to the team through the appropriate channels
