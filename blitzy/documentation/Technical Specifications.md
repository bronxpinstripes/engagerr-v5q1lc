## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### 5.1.1 System Overview

Engagerr employs a modern full-stack architecture built around NextJS with a clear separation between server and client components to optimize both performance and developer experience. The architecture follows these key principles:

- **Hybrid Rendering Approach**: Server components for data-intensive operations and client components for interactive elements, leveraging NextJS 14's App Router architecture
- **API-First Design**: All functionality exposed through well-defined API routes to support both UI operations and future extensibility
- **Multi-Model AI Architecture**: Specialized AI models for different tasks (content analysis, relationship detection, creative suggestions) with intelligent routing
- **Event-Driven Integration**: Asynchronous processing for handling platform integrations, analytics calculations, and notification workflows
- **Graph-Based Data Modeling**: Hierarchical relationship tracking for content using PostgreSQL's LTREE extension

The system boundaries encompass the web application, serverless functions, database services, and containerized AI components, with well-defined interfaces to external services including social platforms, payment processors, and AI providers.

#### 5.1.2 Core Components Table

| Component | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **User Interface Layer** | Deliver interactive experiences for creators and brands | NextJS, React, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI | Responsive design, performance optimization, accessibility |
| **Analytics Engine** | Process and standardize metrics across platforms | PostgreSQL, LTREE extension, Prisma ORM | Data normalization, hierarchical relationships, caching strategy |
| **Discovery Marketplace** | Match creators with brands based on criteria | Search indexing, AI matching models | Match quality, performance at scale, fairness in recommendations |
| **AI Processing System** | Analyze content and relationships with specialized models | DeepSeek, Llama 3, CLIP/BLIP, Mistral | Model selection logic, fallback mechanisms, processing queues |
| **Authentication System** | Manage user identity and session handling | Supabase Auth, SSO providers | Security, token management, permission scoping |
| **Transaction Management** | Handle payments, escrow, and contract workflows | Stripe, contract templates | Payment security, escrow compliance, transaction integrity |
| **Integration Framework** | Connect with social platforms and external services | Platform APIs, OAuth, webhooks | Rate limiting, credential security, resilience |
| **Storage Layer** | Manage structured data and file assets | Supabase PostgreSQL, Supabase Storage | Data modeling, access patterns, backup strategy |

#### 5.1.3 Data Flow Description

The Engagerr platform's data flow follows several key paths, with content and analytics data at the core of the system:

**Content Ingestion and Relationship Mapping:**
Content enters the system primarily through social platform API integrations. When a creator connects their accounts, the Integration Framework fetches content metadata using OAuth tokens. This raw content data passes to the AI Processing System, which analyzes content characteristics and identifies potential parent-child relationships. The Analytics Engine then stores these relationships in the graph structure, calculating standardized metrics that normalize platform-specific engagement data.

**Creator Discovery and Matching:**
When brands search for creators, the Discovery Marketplace component retrieves creator profiles and analytics data from the Storage Layer. Search criteria are processed through specialized indexing to optimize performance, while the AI Processing System enhances results by calculating compatibility scores. The resulting matched creators are presented through the User Interface Layer with their standardized metrics and content samples.

**Transaction Processing:**
Partnership workflows begin in the UI Layer and are managed by the Transaction Management component. Contract templates are populated with specific partnership details, then processed through e-signature flows. Payment information is securely transmitted to Stripe, with the Transaction Management component maintaining escrow status and milestone tracking. When deliverables are approved, payment release events trigger notifications and ledger updates.

**Caching and Data Persistence:**
Frequently accessed data, including analytics dashboards and search results, is cached at multiple levels: edge caching for public profiles, row-level caching for personalized analytics, and application-level caching for AI-processed insights. Time-series analytics data is partitioned in the database for performance, while content relationship data leverages specialized graph structures.

### 5.3 TECHNICAL DECISIONS

#### 5.3.1 Architecture Style Decisions

| Decision Area | Selected Approach | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend Architecture** | NextJS with App Router | SPA with API backend, Micro-frontends | Unified development model with server/client components optimizes both UX performance and developer productivity |
| **Backend Approach** | Serverless/Edge Functions | Containerized services, Traditional servers | Reduced operational complexity, automatic scaling, and global deployment with minimal configuration |
| **Database Architecture** | PostgreSQL with graph extensions | Dedicated graph database, NoSQL solution | Leverages powerful relational capabilities while supporting hierarchical content relationships without introducing additional infrastructure |
| **AI Processing Model** | Multi-model specialized approach | Single general-purpose model, External vendor lock-in | Enables task-specific optimization, cost control, and graceful degradation with fallback options |

The NextJS App Router architecture was selected to unify the development model while providing flexibility in rendering strategies. This approach allows server components to handle data-intensive operations (analytics processing, creator discovery) with reduced JavaScript payload, while client components manage interactive elements (form inputs, visualizations).

For content relationship tracking, we chose PostgreSQL with LTREE extension rather than a dedicated graph database. This decision allows us to maintain a single database technology while efficiently modeling hierarchical relationships. The trade-off of slightly reduced specialized graph querying capabilities is offset by simplified operations and existing team expertise.

    end
```

#### 5.3.2 Communication Pattern Choices

| Pattern | Application Area | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Request-Response** | User-initiated actions, API queries | Synchronous feedback for user actions with immediate confirmation |
| **Webhook Events** | Platform notifications, payment updates | Efficient handling of external system events without polling |
| **Queued Processing** | Content analysis, batch operations | Handles variable processing loads and long-running tasks without blocking |
| **Pub-Sub** | Notifications, real-time updates | Decouples event producers and consumers for flexible scaling |

For real-time user interactions, the system employs request-response patterns to provide immediate feedback. However, for computationally intensive operations like content analysis and relationship mapping, queued processing enables background execution without affecting user experience.

External integrations primarily use webhook events to receive timely updates from platforms without implementing polling mechanisms. This approach reduces unnecessary API calls while ensuring prompt processing of important events like content updates or payment status changes.

#### 5.3.3 Data Storage Solution Rationale

| Data Category | Storage Solution | Key Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **User Profiles & Authentication** | Supabase Auth with PostgreSQL | Built-in security features, OAuth integration, row-level security policies |
| **Content Relationships** | PostgreSQL with LTREE | Hierarchical relationship modeling with efficient querying capabilities |
| **Analytics Metrics** | PostgreSQL with time-series partitioning | Optimized for time-range queries with efficient storage of historical data |
| **Media Assets** | Supabase Storage | Content delivery network integration, permission-based access control |
| **Search Indexes** | PostgreSQL full-text search | Unified technology stack with powerful text search capabilities |

The decision to use PostgreSQL as the primary data store provides a unified storage solution with the flexibility to handle various data models. For content relationships, the LTREE extension enables hierarchical relationship tracking without introducing a separate graph database technology.

Time-series analytics data is partitioned by time ranges to maintain query performance as historical data grows. This approach allows efficient pruning or archiving of older data while maintaining quick access to recent metrics that are more frequently queried.

#### 5.3.4 Caching Strategy Justification

| Cache Level | Implementation | Purpose | Invalidation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Edge Caching** | Vercel Edge Network | Public content, static assets | Time-based with surrogate keys |
| **Application Cache** | Server memory, Redis (future) | Computed results, API responses | Selective invalidation on writes |
| **Database Cache** | Materialized views, result cache | Frequent queries, aggregations | Scheduled or event-triggered refresh |
| **Browser Cache** | HTTP caching, SWR pattern | UI components, user preferences | Stale-while-revalidate pattern |

The multi-level caching strategy optimizes performance across different layers of the application. At the edge, Vercel's global network caches static assets and public content to reduce latency for users worldwide.

For frequently accessed but computation-heavy data such as analytics dashboards, application-level caching stores processed results to avoid redundant calculations. The stale-while-revalidate pattern ensures users see immediate results while data refreshes in the background.

Database caching through materialized views provides optimized access to complex aggregations without repeated computation. This approach is particularly valuable for standardized metrics that combine data from multiple platforms.

#### 5.3.5 Security Mechanism Selection

| Security Area | Selected Approach | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Authentication** | Supabase Auth with JWT | Built-in secure token handling with support for multiple providers |
| **Authorization** | Row Level Security (RLS) policies | Database-enforced access control with fine-grained permissions |
| **API Protection** | Route middleware with token validation | Consistent verification layer for all API endpoints |
| **Sensitive Data** | Encryption at rest, tokenization | Protection of financial and personal information |
| **External Tokens** | Encrypted vault storage | Secure management of social platform credentials |

Supabase Auth was selected for its comprehensive authentication capabilities combined with PostgreSQL's Row Level Security for fine-grained authorization. This approach enforces access control at the database level, preventing unauthorized data access even if application logic contains vulnerabilities.

For external integrations, platform API tokens are stored in an encrypted credential vault rather than directly in the database. This isolation provides an additional security layer for these sensitive credentials that grant access to creator accounts on external platforms.

### 5.4 CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

#### 5.4.1 Monitoring and Observability Approach

Engagerr implements a comprehensive monitoring strategy to ensure system health and performance:

- **Application Performance Monitoring**:
  - Vercel Analytics for server-side performance metrics
  - Web Vitals tracking for client-side experience
  - Custom instrumentation for critical business processes

- **Infrastructure Monitoring**:
  - Supabase metrics for database performance
  - Vercel function invocation and error tracking
  - AI model latency and throughput metrics

- **Business Metrics**:
  - User acquisition and conversion funnels
  - Subscription status and renewal tracking
  - Platform engagement and retention metrics

- **Alerting Strategy**:
  - Tiered alert severity (P1-P4) based on business impact
  - On-call rotation for critical issues
  - Automated incident response for common scenarios

Dashboards are organized by audience (Engineering, Product, Executive) with appropriate levels of detail and business context.

#### 5.4.2 Logging and Tracing Strategy

| Log Category | Implementation | Retention | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Application Logs** | Structured JSON via Vercel Logs | 30 days | Debugging, audit trail |
| **Request Logs** | Edge function logs | 7 days | Performance analysis, debugging |
| **Error Logs** | Structured with context, Sentry integration | 90 days | Error resolution, pattern detection |
| **Security Logs** | Append-only with user context | 1 year | Security investigation, compliance |

The logging strategy emphasizes structured data over free-text to enable efficient querying and analysis. Each log entry includes:

- Request correlation ID for end-to-end tracing
- User context (when applicable)
- Environment information
- Performance metrics for critical operations

Log levels are carefully controlled to balance visibility with storage efficiency, with production environments focusing on actionable information while development environments provide verbose context.

#### 5.4.3 Error Handling Patterns

Engagerr implements a layered error handling approach:

1. **Client-Side Error Handling**:
   - Graceful degradation of UI components
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - User-friendly error messages with recovery actions
   - Error boundaries to contain component failures

2. **Server-Side Error Handling**:
   - Structured error responses with status codes
   - Detailed logging with contextual information
   - Automatic retry for transient failures
   - Circuit breakers for external dependencies

3. **Database Error Handling**:
   - Transaction isolation for critical operations
   - Fallback mechanisms for read operations
   - Constraint violation handling with clear messages
   - Query timeout management

```mermaid

    K -->|No| M[Return Error Code]
    
    E --> N[Check Circuit Breaker]
    N --> O{Circuit Open?}
    O -->|Yes| P[Use Fallback Data]
    O -->|No| Q{Retry Appropriate?}
    Q -->|Yes| R[Backoff and Retry]
    Q -->|No| S[Fail Operation]
    
    F --> T{Transaction Active?}
    T -->|Yes| U[Rollback Transaction]
    T -->|No| V[Isolated Error]
    U --> W[Return Database Error]
    V --> W
```

#### 5.4.4 Authentication and Authorization Framework

The authentication and authorization framework is built on these key principles:

- **Multi-factor Authentication**:
  - Optional for all users
  - Required for financial operations
  - Required for team administrators

- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - Platform-level roles (Admin, User)
  - Creator account roles (Owner, Editor, Analyst, Viewer)
  - Brand account roles (Owner, Campaign Manager, Viewer)

- **Resource-Level Permissions**:
  - Content access controls
  - Analytics visibility settings
  - Partnership visibility rules

- **API Access Security**:
  - Token-based authentication
  - Scoped permissions for each token
  - Rate limiting per endpoint

The implementation uses Supabase Auth for identity management coupled with PostgreSQL Row Level Security policies that enforce access controls at the database level.

#### 5.4.5 Performance Requirements and SLAs

| Service Component | Performance Target | Degradation Threshold | Critical Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Dashboard Loading** | < 500ms | > 1 second | > 3 seconds |
| **Search Results** | < 1 second | > 2 seconds | > 5 seconds |
| **API Response** | < 200ms | > 500ms | > 2 seconds |
| **Content Analysis** | < 24 hours | > 48 hours | > 72 hours |
| **Platform Availability** | 99.9% | < 99.5% | < 99% |

Performance is monitored against these targets with automated alerts when degradation thresholds are crossed. The system implements graceful degradation strategies:

- Progressive loading of dashboard components
- Cached results when real-time data is unavailable
- Simplified AI models during peak load periods
- Prioritization of critical business functions

#### 5.4.6 Disaster Recovery Procedures

Engagerr's disaster recovery strategy focuses on data preservation and service continuity:

- **Data Backup**:
  - Automated database backups every 6 hours
  - Point-in-time recovery for the past 7 days
  - Weekly full backups stored in secondary region

- **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)**:
  - Critical functions: 1 hour
  - Full platform functionality: 4 hours
  - Historical data access: 24 hours

- **Recovery Procedures**:
  - Documented step-by-step recovery playbooks
  - Regular recovery testing through simulated failures
  - Automated restoration processes where possible

- **Business Continuity**:
  - Read-only mode capabilities for essential functions
  - Communication templates for incident updates
  - Escalation procedures and contact hierarchies

The system architecture supports rapid recovery through its cloud-native design, with stateless components that can be quickly redeployed and database systems with robust backup and restore capabilities.

## 6. SYSTEM COMPONENTS DESIGN

### 6.1 USER INTERFACE COMPONENTS

#### 6.1.1 Component Architecture

Engagerr's user interface follows a hierarchical component architecture using React and NextJS, with clear separation between server and client components to optimize performance and interactivity.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "UI Architecture"
        A[App Router] --> B[Layout Components]
        B --> C[Page Components]
        
        C --> D[Server Components]
        C --> E[Client Components]
        
        D --> F[Data Fetching]
        D --> G[Initial Rendering]
        
        E --> H[Interactive Elements]
        E --> I[Client-side State]
        
        subgraph "Component Types"
            J[Containers]
            K[Feature Components]
            L[UI Elements]
            M[Layout Structures]
        end
        
        F --> N[(Server Data)]
        I --> O{Client Actions}
    end
```

The UI architecture implements these key design patterns:

- **Atomic Design Methodology**: Components are organized in a hierarchy from atoms to organisms to templates
- **Component Composition**: Smaller, focused components are composed into feature-rich interfaces
- **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Clear separation between data management and visual presentation
- **Server/Client Component Split**: Strategic use of server components for data-heavy operations

## 6.1 CORE SERVICES ARCHITECTURE

### 6.1.1 SERVICE COMPONENTS

Engagerr utilizes a modular monolithic architecture built on NextJS rather than traditional microservices. The system is structured as functional service components within a unified application, maintaining clear boundaries and responsibilities while avoiding the operational complexity of distributed services.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Client Browser] --> Edge[Vercel Edge Network]
    Edge --> NextJS[NextJS Application]
    
    subgraph "Engagerr Core Application"
        NextJS --> SSR[Server Components]
        NextJS --> CSR[Client Components]
        SSR --> APIRoutes[API Routes Layer]
        
        APIRoutes --> AE[Analytics Engine]
        APIRoutes --> DM[Discovery Marketplace]

        APIRoutes --> IF[Integration Framework]
        
        AE --> DB[(Supabase PostgreSQL)]
        DM --> DB
        TM --> DB
        IF --> DB
        
        APIRoutes --> AIRouter[AI Router]
    end
    
    subgraph "Containerized AI Services"
        AIRouter --> Llama[Llama 3 Container]
        AIRouter --> Mistral[Mistral Container]
    end
    
    subgraph "External Services"
        AIRouter --> DeepSeek[DeepSeek API]
        AIRouter --> CLIP[Hugging Face CLIP/BLIP]
        IF --> SocialAPIs[Social Platform APIs]
        TM --> Stripe[Stripe API]
        APIRoutes --> Resend[Resend Email]
    end
```

#### Service Boundaries and Responsibilities

| Service Component | Primary Responsibility | Implementation Approach | Key Interfaces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Analytics Engine** | Normalize and process content metrics across platforms | NextJS API routes + Server Components | `/api/analytics/*` |
| **Discovery Marketplace** | Match creators with brands based on criteria | NextJS API routes + Server Components | `/api/discovery/*` |
| **Transaction Management** | Handle payments, contracts, and escrow | NextJS API routes + Server Components | `/api/transactions/*` |
| **Integration Framework** | Connect with external platforms | NextJS API routes | `/api/integrations/*` |
| **AI Router** | Route requests to appropriate AI models | NextJS API routes + External calls | `/api/ai/*` |
| **Containerized AI Models** | Process specialized AI tasks locally | Docker containers with API endpoints | Internal HTTP interfaces |

#### Inter-service Communication Patterns

Although Engagerr is not a traditional microservices architecture, the service components follow these communication patterns:

1. **Direct Function Calls**: For components within the NextJS application
2. **Internal HTTP**: For communication with containerized AI models
3. **External APIs**: For third-party services (Stripe, DeepSeek, social platforms)
4. **Server-Triggered Events**: For asynchronous processes and workflows

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client Browser
    participant API as NextJS API Routes
    participant AE as Analytics Engine
    participant AI as AI Router
    participant ContAI as Containerized AI
    participant ExtAI as External AI APIs
    participant DB as Supabase Database
    
    Client->>API: Request Content Analysis
    API->>AE: Process Request
    AE->>DB: Retrieve Content Data
    DB->>AE: Return Content
    AE->>AI: Route for Analysis
    
    alt Complex Analysis
        AI->>ExtAI: Forward to DeepSeek
        ExtAI->>AI: Return Analysis
    else Standard Analysis
        AI->>ContAI: Forward to Local Model
        ContAI->>AI: Return Analysis
    end
    
    AI->>AE: Return Analysis Results
    AE->>DB: Store Results
    AE->>API: Complete Request
    API->>Client: Return Response
```

#### Retry and Fallback Mechanisms

| Service Component | Retry Strategy | Fallback Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AI Router** | Exponential backoff with 3 retries | Model switching (primary → secondary) |
| **Integration Framework** | Adaptive retry with rate-limit awareness | Cached data with degraded experience |
| **Transaction Management** | Immediate retry + manual resolution | Admin notification for intervention |

### 6.1.2 SCALABILITY DESIGN

Engagerr implements a scalability approach that leverages cloud-native capabilities while maintaining a cohesive application structure:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Scalability Architecture"
        Client[Client Requests] --> EdgeNetwork[Vercel Edge Network]
        EdgeNetwork --> LoadBalancer[Automatic Load Balancing]
        LoadBalancer --> ServerlessFunc[Serverless Functions]
        LoadBalancer --> EdgeFunc[Edge Functions]
        
        ServerlessFunc --> AppCore[Core Application Logic]
        EdgeFunc --> CachedResponses[Cached Responses]
        
        AppCore --> ReadReplicas[Database Read Replicas]
        AppCore --> PrimaryDB[Primary Database]
        
        AppCore --> AIManager[AI Processing Manager]
        AIManager --> ContainerPool[Container Pool]
        ContainerPool --> AI1[AI Container 1]
        ContainerPool --> AI2[AI Container 2]
        ContainerPool --> AI3[AI Container 3]
        
        PrimaryDB --> ReadReplicas
    end
```

#### Horizontal/Vertical Scaling Approach

| Component | Scaling Approach | Implementation Method | Triggers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **NextJS Application** | Horizontal | Vercel serverless functions | Request volume, response time |
| **Database** | Read replicas + Vertical | Supabase managed scaling | Query volume, CPU utilization |
| **AI Containers** | Horizontal pool | Container orchestration | Processing queue depth |

#### Performance Optimization Techniques

1. **Edge Caching**:
   - Dashboard components cached at edge locations
   - Static assets globally distributed
   - SSR results cached based on user segments

2. **Database Optimization**:
   - Time-series partitioning for metrics data
   - Materialized views for common analytics queries
   - Read/write splitting for high-volume operations

3. **Compute Optimization**:
   - Model selection based on task complexity
   - Background processing for non-urgent tasks
   - Incremental static regeneration for dashboards

### 6.1.3 RESILIENCE PATTERNS

Engagerr implements resilience patterns to ensure system reliability even during component failures:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Resilience Architecture"
        Client[Client Request] --> ErrorBoundary[React Error Boundary]
        Client --> APIRequest[API Request]
        
        ErrorBoundary --> FallbackUI[Fallback UI Component]
        APIRequest --> CircuitBreaker[Circuit Breaker]
        
        CircuitBreaker -->|Closed| Service[Service Component]
        CircuitBreaker -->|Open| Fallback[Fallback Response]
        
        Service --> ExternalDep[External Dependency]
        ExternalDep -->|Success| Response[Normal Response]
        ExternalDep -->|Failure| BulkheadPattern[Bulkhead Pattern]
        
        BulkheadPattern --> IsolatedFailure[Isolated Failure]
        IsolatedFailure --> DegradedMode[Degraded Mode]
        
        Service --> StoreDB[(Primary Database)]
        StoreDB --> CacheLayer[Cache Layer]
        StoreDB --> ReadReplica[(Read Replica)]
    end
```

#### Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

| Component | Fault Tolerance Pattern | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **UI Layer** | Error Boundaries | React error boundaries with fallback components |
| **API Layer** | Circuit Breakers | Time-window based circuit breakers for external calls |
| **External Services** | Bulkhead Pattern | Isolated resource pools for each integration |

#### Service Degradation Policies

Engagerr implements graceful degradation to maintain core functionality during partial system failures:

1. **Analytics Degradation**:
   - Serve cached metrics data when real-time processing is unavailable
   - Display limited time ranges when historical data is inaccessible
   - Show platform-specific metrics when cross-platform aggregation fails

2. **AI Processing Degradation**:
   - Fall back to simpler models when advanced models are unavailable
   - Queue complex analysis tasks for delayed processing
   - Use pre-computed insights when real-time analysis is unavailable

3. **Transaction Degradation**:
   - Maintain read-only access to contract information during payment processing issues
   - Allow messaging when contract generation is unavailable
   - Provide manual payment instructions when automated processing fails

#### Data Redundancy Approach

| Data Category | Redundancy Strategy | Recovery Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **User Profiles** | Multiple database replicas | Automatic failover |
| **Analytics Data** | Time-series backups + Cached aggregates | Point-in-time recovery |
| **Content Relationships** | Graph structure backups | Rebuilding from source content |
| **Transaction Records** | Multi-region replication | Transaction log replay |

### 6.1.4 INTEGRATION RESILIENCE

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Operational
    
    Operational --> Degraded: Minor Service Disruption
    Operational --> Partial: External API Failure
    Operational --> Offline: Critical Failure
    
    Degraded --> Operational: Service Restored
    Degraded --> Partial: Condition Worsens
    
    Partial --> Degraded: Partial Recovery
    Partial --> Operational: Full Recovery
    Partial --> Offline: Complete Failure
    
    Offline --> Partial: Critical Restoration
    Offline --> Operational: Full Restoration
    
    state Degraded {
        [*] --> CachedData
        CachedData --> LimitedFeatures
        LimitedFeatures --> DegradedNotification
    }
    
    state Partial {
        [*] --> CoreFunctionsOnly
        CoreFunctionsOnly --> AlternatePathways
        AlternatePathways --> UserNotification
    }
    
    state Offline {
        [*] --> MaintenancePage
        MaintenancePage --> StatusUpdates
        StatusUpdates --> RecoveryEstimate
    }
```

The integration resilience strategy ensures system stability even when external dependencies fail, implementing fallback mechanisms, circuit breakers, and recovery procedures for each integration point.

## 6.2 DATABASE DESIGN

### 6.2.1 SCHEMA DESIGN

The database architecture for Engagerr is built on PostgreSQL (via Supabase) and leverages specialized extensions to support the platform's unique requirements, particularly content relationship mapping and analytics processing.

#### Entity Relationship Model

        boolean is_verified
        string auth_provider
    }

    Creator {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        string bio
        string[] categories

```

#### Core Data Models

| Entity | Description | Key Attributes | Relationships |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **User** | Base user account | id, email, password_hash, user_type | Parent to Creator, Brand |
| **Creator** | Content creator profile | user_id, bio, categories, verification_status | Owns Platform, Content |
| **Brand** | Brand/company profile | user_id, company_name, industries, logo_image | Initiates Partnership |
| **Platform** | Connected social platform | creator_id, platform_type, handle, tokens | Contains Content |
| **Content** | Content item across platforms | creator_id, platform_id, external_id, content_type | Has ContentMetrics, Relationships |
| **ContentRelationship** | Graph relationship between content | source_id, target_id, relationship_type | Links Content items |
| **Partnership** | Creator-brand collaboration | creator_id, brand_id, status, budget | Has Contract, Payments |
| **ContentMetrics** | Performance metrics for content | content_id, views, engagements, time_series_data | Belongs to Content |

#### Specialized Data Structures

**Content Relationship Graph Structure**

The content relationship mapping (core differentiator) is implemented using PostgreSQL's LTREE extension, allowing hierarchical relationships between content items to be efficiently stored and queried.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Content ||--o{ ContentNode : "represented as"
    ContentNode ||--o{ ContentNode : "parent-child"
    
    ContentNode {
        uuid id PK
        uuid content_id FK
        ltree path
        int depth
        uuid root_id
    }
```

**Time-Series Analytics Data**

Analytics data is structured using a time-series approach with partitioning for efficient querying of historical metrics.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Content ||--o{ DailyMetrics : "has"
    Creator ||--o{ AggregateMetrics : "has"
    
    DailyMetrics {
        uuid id PK
        uuid content_id FK
        uuid platform_id FK
        date metric_date
        int views
        int engagements
        int shares
        int comments
        int likes
        float watch_time
    }
    
    AggregateMetrics {
        uuid id PK
        uuid entity_id FK
        enum entity_type
        enum period_type
        date start_date
        date end_date
        jsonb metrics
    }
```

#### Indexing Strategy

| Table | Index Type | Columns | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Content | B-Tree | creator_id, platform_id | Efficient content lookup by creator and platform |
| Content | B-Tree | external_id, platform_id | Efficient lookup by platform-specific ID |
| Content | GiST | path | Hierarchical path queries for content relationships |
| ContentRelationship | B-Tree | source_content_id | Fast lookup of child content |
| ContentRelationship | B-Tree | target_content_id | Fast lookup of parent content |
| DailyMetrics | B-Tree | content_id, metric_date | Time-series metric retrieval |
| DailyMetrics | B-Tree | platform_id, metric_date | Platform-specific metric analysis |
| Partnership | B-Tree | creator_id, status | Creator partnership filtering |
| Partnership | B-Tree | brand_id, status | Brand partnership filtering |

#### Partitioning Approach

Time-series analytics data employs range partitioning by date to maintain query performance as historical data grows:

| Table | Partition Type | Partition Key | Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DailyMetrics | Range | metric_date | Monthly partitions with 24-month retention |
| AudienceMetrics | Range | date | Monthly partitions with 24-month retention |
| AggregateMetrics | Range | end_date | Monthly partitions with 36-month retention |
| ContentMetrics | Range | date | Monthly partitions with 24-month retention |

#### Replication Configuration

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PrimaryDB[(Primary Database)] --> ReadReplica1[(Read Replica 1)]
    PrimaryDB --> ReadReplica2[(Read Replica 2)]
    
    subgraph "Write Operations"
        WriteQueue[Write Queue] --> PrimaryDB
    end
    
    subgraph "Read Operations"
        AnalyticsQueries[Analytics Queries] --> ReadReplica1
        DiscoveryQueries[Discovery Queries] --> ReadReplica2
        UserQueries[User Queries] --> ReadBalancer[Read Balancer]
        ReadBalancer --> ReadReplica1
        ReadBalancer --> ReadReplica2
    end
```

The replication strategy employs:

| Replication Type | Purpose | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Synchronous | Critical data (payments, contracts) | 1 sync replica with COMMIT guarantee |
| Asynchronous | Analytics and read-heavy operations | 2+ replicas with eventual consistency |
| Logical Replication | Historical metrics for reporting | Selective publication of time-series data |

#### Backup Architecture

| Backup Type | Frequency | Retention | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full Database Backup | Daily | 30 days | All database objects and data |
| Incremental Backup | Hourly | 7 days | Transaction logs and changes |
| Point-in-Time Recovery | Continuous | 7 days | Transaction log streaming |
| Schema Backup | On migration | Unlimited | Database structure versions |

### 6.2.2 DATA MANAGEMENT

#### Migration Procedures

Engagerr uses Prisma ORM for database migrations, following this workflow:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Dev[Development Schema Changes] --> PrismaMigrate[Prisma Migrate]
    PrismaMigrate --> MigrationScript[Migration Script Generation]
    MigrationScript --> Review[Team Review]
    Review --> Test[Test Migration]
    Test --> ApplyStaging[Apply to Staging]
    ApplyStaging --> VerifyStaging[Verify Staging]
    VerifyStaging --> ApplyProduction[Apply to Production]
    ApplyProduction --> Monitoring[Post-Migration Monitoring]
```

| Migration Phase | Tools | Verification Steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Schema Design | Prisma Schema Language | Type checking, constraint validation |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Data | Indefinite | N/A - Retained while account active | On account deletion + 30 days |
| Content Metadata | Indefinite | N/A - Core business data | Never (historical value) |
| Metrics Data | 24 months active | Aggregation after 24 months | Raw data after 36 months |
| Transaction Records | 7 years active | Read-only archive after 2 years | Regulatory requirement-based |
| Platform Tokens | Until refresh/revocation | Encrypted backup | Immediate on disconnect |

#### Data Storage and Retrieval Mechanisms

| Data Type | Storage Mechanism | Retrieval Pattern | Optimization |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Relational Data | PostgreSQL Tables | ORM-based access via Prisma | Prepared statements, connection pooling |

| Aggregate Cache | Materialized Views | Pre-computed analytics | Scheduled or event-based refresh |
| Edge Cache | Vercel Edge Caching | Public creator profiles | Surrogate keys, stale-while-revalidate |

### 6.2.3 COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

#### Data Retention Rules

| Data Category | Retention Period | Justification | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Accounts | Until deletion + 30 days | User autonomy + deletion buffer | Soft deletion with purge job |
| Payment Information | 7 years | Financial regulations | Encrypted storage, access logging |
| Communication Records | 2 years | Dispute resolution | Archived with limited access |
| Analytics Data | Aggregate indefinitely, raw 36 months | Business intelligence | Tiered storage with aggregation |
| Platform Tokens | Until revocation | Integration functionality | Encrypted vault with rotation |

#### Backup and Fault Tolerance Policies

| Data Corruption | Point-in-time recovery | < 1 hour | < 15 minutes |
| Catastrophic Failure | Backup restoration | < 4 hours | < 24 hours |

#### Privacy Controls

| Privacy Aspect | Implementation | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Encryption | Column-level encryption for sensitive data | PII, payment info, platform credentials |
| Anonymization | Aggregation and pseudonymization for analytics | Audience demographics, engagement patterns |
| Data Portability | API-based export functionality | All user-owned content and data |
| Right to Erasure | Automated deletion workflow | All personal data except regulatory requirements |
| Consent Management | Granular permission storage | Platform access, data usage, communications |

#### Audit Mechanisms

```

The Row Level Security (RLS) model in Supabase enforces:

| Entity | Policy Type | Policy Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User Data | Access | Only self or admin can view full profile |
| Creator Content | Ownership | Creator and authorized team members only |
| Analytics Data | Visibility | Based on subscription tier and ownership |
| Partnership Data | Dual Access | Both creator and brand have appropriate access |
| Platform Credentials | Restricted | Encrypted with application-level access only |

### 6.2.4 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

#### Query Optimization Patterns

| Query Pattern | Optimization Technique | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creator Analytics | Materialized views | Pre-calculated aggregates refreshed hourly |
| Content Relationships | Graph traversal functions | Custom LTREE path functions for hierarchy |
| Creator Discovery | Composite indexes | Multi-column indexes for filtered searches |
| Time-series Analytics | Partition pruning | Date-range queries mapped to specific partitions |
| Full-text Search | GIN indexes | Optimized indexes for content and profile search |

Frequently used query patterns are optimized through stored procedures:

```sql
-- Example of a stored procedure for efficient content family retrieval
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_content_family(root_content_id UUID)
RETURNS TABLE (
    content_id UUID,
    title TEXT,
    content_type TEXT,
    platform_type TEXT,
    relationship_type TEXT,
    depth INT,
    metrics JSONB
) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    WITH RECURSIVE content_tree AS (
        -- Base query for root content
        SELECT 
            c.id AS content_id,
            c.title,
            c.content_type,
            p.platform_type,
            'ROOT' AS relationship_type,
            0 AS depth,
            jsonb_build_object(
                'views', cm.views,
                'engagements', cm.engagements,
                'shares', cm.shares
            ) AS metrics
        FROM content c
        JOIN platform p ON c.platform_id = p.id
        JOIN content_metrics cm ON c.id = cm.content_id
        WHERE c.id = root_content_id
        
        UNION ALL
        
        -- Recursive query for child content
        SELECT
            c.id AS content_id,
            c.title,
            c.content_type,
            p.platform_type,
            cr.relationship_type,
            ct.depth + 1,
            jsonb_build_object(
                'views', cm.views,
                'engagements', cm.engagements,
                'shares', cm.shares
            ) AS metrics
        FROM content c
        JOIN platform p ON c.platform_id = p.id
        JOIN content_relationship cr ON c.id = cr.target_content_id
        JOIN content_metrics cm ON c.id = cm.content_id
        JOIN content_tree ct ON ct.content_id = cr.source_content_id
        WHERE ct.depth < 5 -- Prevent infinite recursion and limit depth
    )
    SELECT * FROM content_tree
    ORDER BY depth, platform_type;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Caching Strategy

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request[Client Request] --> CacheCheck{Cache Valid?}
    
    CacheCheck -->|Yes| ServeCache[Serve Cached Data]
    CacheCheck -->|No| FetchData[Fetch Fresh Data]
    
    FetchData --> ProcessData[Process Data]

        DBCache[Database Cache]
        EdgeCache[Edge Cache]
        RedisCache[Redis Cache - Future]
    end
```

| Cache Type | Implementation | Use Cases | Invalidation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Application Cache | Server memory | API responses, computed values | TTL-based with manual purge |
| Database Cache | Materialized views | Aggregate analytics, rankings | Scheduled refresh (hourly) |
| Edge Cache | Vercel Edge | Public profiles, static assets | Surrogate keys, revalidation |
| Row Cache | Supabase caching | Frequently accessed entities | Write-through invalidation |

#### Connection Pooling

| Pool Type | Pool Size | Allocation Strategy | Monitoring |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default Pool | 10-50 connections | Dynamic based on load | Connection wait time, utilization |
| Analytics Pool | 5-20 connections | Dedicated for reporting queries | Query duration, pool saturation |
| Transaction Pool | 10-30 connections | Isolated for financial operations | Transaction rate, pool errors |

The connection pooling strategy is implemented through Supabase's managed PostgreSQL service with custom pool configurations:

```
PGBOUNCER_DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE=50
PGBOUNCER_DEFAULT_POOL_MODE=transaction
PGBOUNCER_MAX_CLIENT_CONN=500
PGBOUNCER_IDLE_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT=300
```

#### Read/Write Splitting

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request[API Request] --> OperationType{Operation Type}
    
    OperationType -->|Write| PrimaryDB[(Primary Database)]
    OperationType -->|Read| ReadType{Read Type}
    
    ReadType -->|Analytics| AnalyticsReplica[(Analytics Replica)]
    ReadType -->|User Profile| ProfileReplica[(Profile Replica)]
    ReadType -->|Discovery| DiscoveryReplica[(Discovery Replica)]
    
    PrimaryDB -->|Replication| AnalyticsReplica
    PrimaryDB -->|Replication| ProfileReplica
    PrimaryDB -->|Replication| DiscoveryReplica
```

The read/write splitting strategy employs:

| Operation Type | Database Target | Consistency Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All writes | Primary database | Strong consistency |
| User profile reads | User replica (low latency) | Strong consistency |
| Analytics dashboard reads | Analytics replica (optimized) | Eventually consistent (< 5 min lag) |
| Creator discovery searches | Discovery replica (optimized) | Eventually consistent (< 15 min lag) |

#### Batch Processing Approach

| Process Type | Batch Strategy | Scheduling | Optimization |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Platform Data Sync | Queue-based batching | Hourly with rate limiting | Priority-based for active creators |
| Analytics Calculation | Incremental processing | 15-minute intervals | Content family grouping |
| Notification Delivery | Bulk processing | 5-minute batches | Priority tiering |
| Search Index Updates | Debounced updates | Real-time + batch | Partial updates for critical changes |

Batch operations are optimized through database-native techniques:

```sql
-- Example of efficient batch update for metric normalization
INSERT INTO normalized_metrics (content_id, metric_date, views, engagement_rate, standardized_score)
SELECT 
    content_id,
    metric_date,
    views,
    CASE 
        WHEN platform_type = 'youtube' THEN engagements::float / NULLIF(views, 0) * 100
        WHEN platform_type = 'tiktok' THEN engagements::float / NULLIF(views, 0) * 85
        WHEN platform_type = 'instagram' THEN engagements::float / NULLIF(views, 0) * 120
        ELSE engagements::float / NULLIF(views, 0) * 100
    END AS engagement_rate,
    (views * 0.3) + (engagements * 0.5) + (shares * 0.2) AS standardized_score
FROM raw_platform_metrics
WHERE metric_date = CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
ON CONFLICT (content_id, metric_date) 
DO UPDATE SET
    views = EXCLUDED.views,
    engagement_rate = EXCLUDED.engagement_rate,
    standardized_score = EXCLUDED.standardized_score;
```

## 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### 6.3.1 API DESIGN

Engagerr implements a comprehensive API architecture to facilitate integration with multiple external platforms and services while maintaining security, performance, and developer experience.

#### Protocol Specifications

| Protocol | Usage | Implementation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REST | Primary API style | NextJS API routes | Used for most platform integrations and internal services |
| GraphQL | Limited usage | Apollo Client | Used selectively for complex data requirements |
| Webhooks | Event notifications | Custom handlers | Receives real-time updates from platforms and payment services |
| WebSockets | Real-time communication | Supabase Realtime | Used for messaging and notification delivery |

The API architecture follows these design principles:

- **Resource-Oriented Design**: APIs are organized around resources with clear naming conventions
- **Standard HTTP Methods**: Consistent use of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for CRUD operations
- **Status Codes**: Proper HTTP status codes with standardized error responses
- **Content Negotiation**: Support for multiple formats with JSON as default

```mermaid

    ExternalAdapter --> SocialAPIs[Social Platform APIs]
    ExternalAdapter --> PaymentAPI[Payment Services]
    ExternalAdapter --> EmailAPI[Email Services]
    ExternalAdapter --> AIAPI[AI Services]
```

#### Authentication Methods

| Authentication Type | Implementation | Usage | Security Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OAuth 2.0 | Social platform SDKs | Platform integrations | Token storage in secure vault |
| JWT | NextAuth.js | Internal API access | Short expiration with refresh |
| API Keys | Custom headers | Partner access | Rate limiting and scope control |
| Session Cookies | Supabase Auth | Web application | HTTP-only, secure flags enabled |

The OAuth flow for social platform integrations follows this sequence:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Engagerr
    participant Platform
    
    User->>Engagerr: Connect Platform Account
    Engagerr->>Platform: Initiate OAuth Flow
    Platform->>User: Request Authorization
    User->>Platform: Grant Permission
    Platform->>Engagerr: Return Authorization Code
    Engagerr->>Platform: Exchange Code for Tokens
    Platform->>Engagerr: Return Access & Refresh Tokens
    Engagerr->>Engagerr: Store Tokens Securely
    Engagerr->>User: Confirm Connection
```

#### Authorization Framework

The authorization model implements multiple layers of access control:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: User roles determine feature access
- **Resource-Based Permissions**: Ownership and sharing rules govern resource access
- **Scoped Tokens**: OAuth access tokens with limited scope for platform operations
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control via Supabase policies

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request[API Request] --> AuthCheck{Authenticated?}
    
    AuthCheck -->|No| Reject[Reject Request 401]
    AuthCheck -->|Yes| RoleCheck{Role Check}
    
    RoleCheck -->|Insufficient| Forbidden[Forbidden 403]
    RoleCheck -->|Sufficient| ResourceCheck{Resource Access}
    
    ResourceCheck -->|Denied| Forbidden
    ResourceCheck -->|Granted| ScopeCheck{Token Scope}
    
    ScopeCheck -->|Invalid| Forbidden
    ScopeCheck -->|Valid| RLSCheck{Row-Level Security}
    
    RLSCheck -->|Denied| Forbidden
    RLSCheck -->|Granted| Proceed[Process Request]
```

#### Rate Limiting Strategy

Engagerr implements a multi-tier rate limiting strategy to ensure system stability and fair usage:

| Limit Type | Scope | Implementation | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Global API | Per IP address | Sliding window | 1000 requests per minute |
| User-based | Per user ID | Token bucket | Varies by subscription tier |
| Endpoint-specific | Per endpoint | Fixed window | Customized for endpoint sensitivity |
| Platform-aware | Per external platform | Leaky bucket | Respects external API quotas |

When rate limits are exceeded, the system:
1. Returns a 429 Too Many Requests status code
2. Includes Retry-After headers with backoff guidance
3. Provides remaining quota information in response headers
4. Logs excessive usage for abuse prevention

#### Versioning Approach

| Versioning Aspect | Strategy | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API Versioning | URL Path-based | `/api/v1/resource` format |
| Deprecation Policy | Sunset header | Min. 6-month deprecation period |
| Backward Compatibility | Schema evolution | Additive changes where possible |
| Documentation | Versioned OpenAPI specs | Clear version differences highlighted |

The versioning strategy emphasizes stability while enabling evolution:

- **Interface Stability**: Breaking changes only in major version increments
- **Graceful Degradation**: New clients work with old servers and vice versa
- **Feature Flags**: Progressive feature rollout within versions
- **Change Logs**: Detailed documentation of changes between versions

#### Documentation Standards

| Documentation Element | Tool/Format | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API Reference | OpenAPI (Swagger) | Machine-readable API specification |
| Integration Guides | Markdown + Code Examples | Step-by-step implementation guides |
| Authentication Docs | Interactive Tutorials | Secure implementation guidance |
| Webhooks Reference | Event Catalogs | Comprehensive event documentation |

All documentation follows these principles:
- Clear examples for every endpoint and parameter
- Interactive testing capabilities where possible
- Sample code in multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, PHP)
- Consistent terminology and formatting

### 6.3.2 MESSAGE PROCESSING

Engagerr implements event-driven architecture patterns to handle asynchronous integration flows, ensuring reliable message processing across system boundaries.

#### Event Processing Patterns

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Event Sources"
        PlatformEvents[Platform API Events]
        SystemEvents[Internal System Events]
        UserActions[User-Triggered Events]
        AIProcessing[AI Processing Events]
    end
    
    subgraph "Event Processing"
        EventRouter[Event Router]
        EventValidator[Event Validator]
        EventEnricher[Event Enricher]
        EventProcessor[Event Processor]
    end
    
    subgraph "Event Consumers"
        Analytics[Analytics Engine]
        Notifications[Notification Service]
        ContentProcess[Content Processor]
        IntegrationSync[Integration Sync]
    end
    
    PlatformEvents --> EventRouter
    SystemEvents --> EventRouter
    UserActions --> EventRouter
    AIProcessing --> EventRouter
    
    EventRouter --> EventValidator
    EventValidator --> EventEnricher
    EventEnricher --> EventProcessor
    
    EventProcessor --> Analytics
    EventProcessor --> Notifications
    EventProcessor --> ContentProcess
    EventProcessor --> IntegrationSync
```

The event processing system implements the following patterns:

| Pattern | Implementation | Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Publisher-Subscriber | Custom implementation | Platform events, system notifications |
| Event Sourcing | Event log + processing | Creator activity, content updates |
| CQRS | Read/write separation | Analytics data processing, content mapping |
| Saga Pattern | State machines | Multi-step workflows like partnerships |

#### Message Queue Architecture

For reliable message processing, Engagerr employs a queue-based architecture:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Source[Event Source] --> Dispatcher[Event Dispatcher]
    
    Dispatcher --> PriorityQueue[Priority Queue]
    Dispatcher --> StandardQueue[Standard Queue]
    Dispatcher --> BackgroundQueue[Background Queue]
    
    PriorityQueue --> WorkerPool1[High Priority Workers]
    StandardQueue --> WorkerPool2[Standard Workers]
    BackgroundQueue --> WorkerPool3[Background Workers]
    
    WorkerPool1 --> DLQ1[Dead Letter Queue]
    WorkerPool2 --> DLQ2[Dead Letter Queue]
    WorkerPool3 --> DLQ3[Dead Letter Queue]
    
    DLQ1 --> ErrorHandler[Error Handler]
    DLQ2 --> ErrorHandler
    DLQ3 --> ErrorHandler
    
    ErrorHandler --> Retry[Retry Mechanism]
    ErrorHandler --> Alert[Alert System]
    
    Retry --> Dispatcher
```

| Queue Type | Purpose | Processing Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Priority Queue | Critical operations (payments, contracts) | Immediate processing, dedicated workers |
| Standard Queue | Normal operations (content updates) | Balanced throughput, shared worker pool |
| Background Queue | Batch operations (analytics) | Resource-aware scheduling, lower priority |
| Dead Letter Queue | Failed message handling | Error analysis and recovery procedures |

The implementation leverages NextJS serverless functions with custom job scheduling and monitoring.

#### Stream Processing Design

For real-time data processing requirements, Engagerr implements streaming patterns:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Sources[Event Sources] --> StreamProcessor[Stream Processor]
    
    StreamProcessor --> Filter[Event Filter]
    Filter --> Transform[Event Transformer]
    Transform --> Enricher[Event Enricher]
    
    Enricher --> WindowProcessor[Window Processor]
    Enricher --> PatternDetector[Pattern Detector]
    
    WindowProcessor --> Aggregator[Metrics Aggregator]
    PatternDetector --> AlertGenerator[Alert Generator]
    
    Aggregator --> MetricsStore[Metrics Database]
    AlertGenerator --> NotificationSystem[Notification System]
```

| Stream Processing Element | Implementation | Application |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Event Filtering | Rule-based filtering | Platform-specific content filtering |
| Event Transformation | Schema normalization | Standardizing metrics across platforms |
| Window Processing | Time/count windows | Rolling metrics calculations |
| Pattern Detection | CEP rules | Engagement spike detection, trend identification |

The stream processing architecture primarily handles:
- Real-time analytics updates from platform webhooks
- Content publication and performance events
- Audience behavior pattern detection
- Creator-brand interaction events

#### Batch Processing Flows

For high-volume or computationally intensive processing, batch operations are implemented:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Scheduler[Job Scheduler] --> JobQueue[Job Queue]
    
    JobQueue --> Dispatcher[Job Dispatcher]
    
    Dispatcher --> Worker1[Worker 1]
    Dispatcher --> Worker2[Worker 2]
    Dispatcher --> Worker3[Worker 3]
    
    Worker1 --> ResultCollector[Result Collector]
    Worker2 --> ResultCollector
    Worker3 --> ResultCollector
    
    ResultCollector --> Storage[Data Storage]

sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client as Engagerr Client
    participant Auth as Supabase Auth
    participant API as API Routes
    participant DB as Database

    User->>Client: Login Request
    Client->>Auth: Authentication Request
    Auth->>Auth: Validate Credentials
    
    alt Valid Credentials
        Auth->>DB: Create Session
        Auth->>Client: Return JWT + Refresh Token
        Client->>Client: Store JWT in Memory
        Client->>Client: Store Refresh Token (HTTP-only Cookie)
        Client->>User: Display Success & Redirect
    else Invalid Credentials
        Auth->>Client: Return Error
        Client->>User: Display Error Message
    end
    
    User->>Client: Access Protected Resource
    Client->>API: Request with JWT
    API->>API: Validate Token
    
    alt Valid Token
        API->>DB: Authorized Request (with RLS)
        DB->>API: Return Data
        API->>Client: Return Response
    else Invalid/Expired Token
        API->>Client: 401 Unauthorized
        Client->>Auth: Attempt Token Refresh
        Auth->>Client: New JWT (if refresh valid)
        Client->>API: Retry Request with New JWT
    end
```

**Identity Management**

| Method | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Email/Password | Supabase Auth | Primary authentication method |
| Social SSO | OAuth 2.0 (Google, Apple) | Simplified onboarding |
| Platform OAuth | OAuth 2.0 | Social platform integration |

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

| MFA Type | Implementation | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time-based OTP | Supabase Auth MFA | Optional for standard accounts |
| App Authenticator | TOTP Standard | Required for financial operations |
| SMS Verification | Twilio integration | Required for Enterprise tier |

The MFA implementation follows a risk-based approach:

- Required for administrative actions

- Required when logging in from new devices
- Required for Enterprise accounts by default

**Session Management**

| Session Control | Implementation | Security Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session Duration | 4-hour active JWT | Limits exposure of active sessions |
| Refresh Tokens | 30-day HTTP-only cookie | Secures long-term authorization |
| Concurrent Sessions | Session registry with limits | Prevents unauthorized access |
| Session Revocation | Immediate server-side invalidation | Mitigates compromised accounts |

The system automatically terminates sessions in the following conditions:
- Password change
- MFA reset
- Suspicious activity detection
- User-initiated logout
- Exceeding maximum concurrent sessions (varies by tier)

**Token Management**

Engagerr uses a multi-tiered token system:

- **Authentication JWT**: Short-lived (4 hours), used for API authentication
- **Refresh Tokens**: Longer-lived (30 days), stored in HTTP-only cookies with secure flag
- **Platform Access Tokens**: Encrypted storage with automatic rotation
- **API Access Tokens**: Scoped permissions with audit logging

**Password Policies**

| Policy Element | Requirement | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Password Complexity | Minimum 10 characters with complexity | Client and server validation |
| Password History | No reuse of last 5 passwords | Password history table |
| Account Lockout | 5 failed attempts triggers 15-min cooldown | Progressive timeout with detection |
| Password Rotation | 90-day reminder (optional enforcement) | Notification with grace period |

# 6.6 TESTING STRATEGY

## 6.6.1 TESTING APPROACH

Engagerr requires a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure the platform delivers a reliable, performant experience for both creator and brand users. This strategy implements a multi-layered approach combining unit, integration, and end-to-end testing with special considerations for AI components and third-party integrations.

### Unit Testing

The foundation of our testing pyramid focuses on isolated testing of individual components and functions.

| Aspect | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Frameworks & Tools** | Jest for test running and assertions, React Testing Library for component testing, Testing Library User Event for interaction testing |
| **Directory Structure** | Co-located tests with implementation in `__tests__` directories with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extensions |
| **Component Coverage** | Server components, client components, utility functions, hooks, and state management |

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    UnitTest[Unit Test] --> ComponentTest[Component Testing]
    UnitTest --> HookTest[Hook Testing]
    UnitTest --> UtilTest[Utility Function Testing]
    UnitTest --> StateTest[State Management Testing]
    
    ComponentTest --> ServerComp[Server Components]
    ComponentTest --> ClientComp[Client Components]
    ComponentTest --> SharedComp[Shared Components]
    
    HookTest --> CustomHook[Custom Hooks]
    HookTest --> QueryHook[Data Query Hooks]
    
    UtilTest --> DataTrans[Data Transformers]
    UtilTest --> Formatters[Formatters]
    UtilTest --> Validators[Validators]
    
    StateTest --> LocalState[Component State]
    StateTest --> GlobalState[Global State]
```

Our mocking strategy includes:

- **Network Requests**: Use Jest's mock functions for API calls
- **External Libraries**: Mock with Jest's `jest.mock()`
- **Complex Dependencies**: Use explicit manual mocks in a `__mocks__` directory
- **AI Models**: Create simplified mock implementations that return predefined results

Example test pattern for a component:

```typescript
// Content relationship visualization component test example
describe('ContentFamilyGraph', () => {
  test('should render parent-child relationships correctly', () => {
    // Arrange
    const mockRelationshipData = generateMockRelationshipData();
    
    // Act
    render(<ContentFamilyGraph data={mockRelationshipData} />);
    
    // Assert
    expect(screen.getByText('Parent Content')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getAllByTestId('child-node')).toHaveLength(3);
    expect(screen.getAllByTestId('relationship-edge')).toHaveLength(3);
  });
  
  test('should allow expanding collapsed nodes', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const mockRelationshipData = generateMockRelationshipData();
    
    // Act
    render(<ContentFamilyGraph data={mockRelationshipData} collapsed={true} />);
    const expandButton = screen.getByLabelText('Expand node');
    
    // Assert - before click
    expect(screen.queryAllByTestId('child-node')).toHaveLength(0);
    
    // Act - user interaction
    await userEvent.click(expandButton);
    
    // Assert - after click
    expect(screen.getAllByTestId('child-node')).toHaveLength(3);
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different parts of the system work together correctly, focusing on API routes, database operations, and service interactions.

| Aspect | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **API Testing** | SuperTest for API route testing with simulated requests |
| **Database Testing** | Test database with seeded data and isolated transactions |
| **Service Mocking** | Mock Service Worker (MSW) for external API simulation |
| **Auth Mocking** | Custom auth context providers for authenticated routes |

Our database integration testing approach:

1. Use a dedicated test database with automated schema migration
2. Seed test data before test execution
3. Wrap tests in transactions that roll back after each test
4. Reset database state between test suites

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    IntegrationTest[Integration Test] --> APITest[API Route Testing]
    IntegrationTest --> DBTest[Database Integration]
    IntegrationTest --> ServiceTest[Service Integration]
    
    APITest --> AuthAPI[Auth Protected Routes]
    APITest --> PublicAPI[Public Routes]
    APITest --> WebhookAPI[Webhook Handlers]
    
    DBTest --> QueryTest[Query Testing]
    DBTest --> MutationTest[Mutation Testing]
    DBTest --> TransactionTest[Transaction Testing]
    
    ServiceTest --> StripeTest[Payment Processing]
    ServiceTest --> AITest[AI Model Integration]
    ServiceTest --> SocialTest[Social Platform Integration]
```

Example API route test:

```typescript
// Content relationship API test example
describe('GET /api/content/:contentId/family', () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    // Seed test database with content relationships
    await seedTestDatabase();
  });
  
  afterAll(async () => {
    // Clean up test data
    await cleanupTestDatabase();
  });
  
  test('should return content family when authenticated', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const authToken = generateTestAuthToken('creator-user');
    
    // Act
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/api/content/test-content-id/family')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`);
    
    // Assert
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.body.nodes).toHaveLength(5);
    expect(response.body.edges).toHaveLength(4);
  });
  
  test('should return 401 when not authenticated', async () => {
    // Act
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/api/content/test-content-id/family');
    
    // Assert
    expect(response.status).toBe(401);
  });
});
```

1. Record representative test cases for regression testing
2. Implement fuzzing techniques for resilience testing
3. Test model fallback mechanisms by simulating failures
4. Evaluate performance degradation with increasing load

### Social Platform Integration Testing

Testing social platform integrations requires specialized approaches:

| Test Type | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Mock Responses** | Simulated platform API responses based on real data |
| **Rate Limit Testing** | Validation of rate limiting and backoff strategies |
| **Authentication Testing** | OAuth flow testing with test accounts |
| **Webhook Testing** | Simulated platform events and notifications |

Integration test considerations:

1. Test authorization token refresh flows
2. Simulate API failures and rate limit errors
3. Validate webhook signature verification
4. Test platform-specific data transformations

## ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL INFORMATION

### AI Model Specifications

The multi-model AI architecture is a key differentiator for Engagerr, allowing specialized processing for different tasks. Here are the detailed specifications for each model in the system:

| Model | Type | Parameters | Primary Use Cases | Hardware Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DeepSeek | LLM | 7B-67B | General language tasks, creative generation | Cloud API |
| Llama 3 | LLM | 8B | Content analysis, relationship detection | 4 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 1 GPU |
| CLIP/BLIP | Vision-Language | 2B | Visual content analysis, image understanding | Cloud API |
| Mistral | LLM | 7B | Classification, initial matching | 2 vCPU, 8GB RAM |

### Content Relationship Graph Schema

The content relationship mapping uses a specialized graph structure implemented in PostgreSQL:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ContentNode {
        uuid id PK
        uuid content_id FK
        ltree path
        int depth
        uuid root_id
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    
    RelationshipType {
        string type
        string description
        int weight
    }
    
    ContentNode ||--o{ ContentNode : "parent_of"
    ContentNode }o--|| RelationshipType : "has_type"
```

The LTREE implementation follows this pattern:

| Path Format | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Root Node | `content_123` | Original parent content |
| First Level | `content_123.youtube_456` | Direct child content |
| Second Level | `content_123.youtube_456.tiktok_789` | Derivative of child content |
| Cross-Platform | `content_123.*.tiktok_789` | Any TikTok content derived from root |

### Platform API Integration Details
