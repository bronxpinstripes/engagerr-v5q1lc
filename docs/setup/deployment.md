### Infrastructure Setup

Engagerr uses Terraform to provision and manage cloud infrastructure resources. This approach ensures consistency, repeatability, and version control for infrastructure changes.

1.  **Terraform Project Structure**:

    The Terraform project is organized into modules for each major infrastructure component:

    ```text
    terraform/
    ├── modules/
    │   ├── vpc/
    │   │   ├── main.tf
    │   │   ├── variables.tf
    │   │   └── outputs.tf
    │   ├── ecs/
    │   │   ├── main.tf
    │   │   ├── variables.tf
    │   │   └── outputs.tf
    │   └── ...
    ├── environments/
    │   ├── staging/
    │   │   ├── main.tf
    │   │   ├── variables.tf
    │   │   └── terraform.tfvars
    │   └── production/
    │       ├── main.tf
    │       ├── variables.tf
    │       └── terraform.tfvars
    └── ...
    ```

2.  **Terraform Backend Configuration**:

    Configure a Terraform backend for state management. This can be a cloud storage service like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage.

    Example for AWS S3:

    ```terraform
    terraform {
      backend "s3" {
        bucket = "engagerr-terraform-state"
        key    = "engagerr/terraform.tfstate"
        region = "us-east-1"
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Environment-Specific Variables**:

    Define environment-specific variables in `terraform.tfvars` files for each environment (staging, production).

    Example for staging:

    ```terraform
    environment = "staging"
    aws_region  = "us-east-1"
    instance_type = "t3.medium"
    ```

4.  **Infrastructure Provisioning**:

    Run the following commands to initialize, plan, and apply the Terraform configuration:

    ```bash
    cd terraform/environments/<environment>
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

5.  **Post-Infrastructure Setup Verification**:
