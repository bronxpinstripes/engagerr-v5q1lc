## Introduction

Welcome to Engagerr — the unified platform built specifically for content creators like you who create across multiple platforms.

### The Challenge Engagerr Solves

As a creator, you likely publish content across YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and other platforms. Each platform provides its own analytics, but none show you the complete picture of your content's performance. This fragmentation makes it difficult to:

- Understand your true reach and engagement across platforms
- Track how content performs when repurposed across different formats
- Present your total value to potential brand partners
- Make data-driven decisions about content strategy

### Our Unique Solution: Content Relationship Mapping

Engagerr's proprietary content relationship mapping technology solves this fundamental problem by connecting all your content pieces together into a unified family tree. For example, when you turn a podcast episode into a YouTube video, Instagram carousel, and TikTok clips, Engagerr tracks these relationships, allowing you to:

- See the aggregate performance of your content across all platforms
- Understand which formats and platforms generate the best engagement
- Demonstrate your true reach to brands by showing the complete content journey
- Identify which repurposing strategies are most effective

### Key Benefits for Creators

This guide will walk you through every aspect of the Engagerr platform, from setting up your account to managing brand partnerships and optimizing your content strategy.

Changes to the time period affect all metrics and visualizations on the dashboard.

## Content Relationship Mapping

Content relationship mapping is Engagerr's flagship feature that tracks how your content connects across platforms.

### Understanding Content Relationships

In today's creator economy, a single piece of content often exists in multiple formats across different platforms. For example:

1. You record a podcast episode (parent content)
2. You upload the video version to YouTube
3. You create Instagram carousel highlights
4. You extract TikTok clips from the episode
5. Viewers create reaction videos to your content

Traditional analytics treat these as separate, unrelated content pieces. Engagerr's relationship mapping connects them into a "content family," showing you the true reach and impact of your original ideas.

### Accessing the Content Mapping Interface

From your dashboard, click "Content Mapping" in the left navigation bar to access the full mapping interface.

The Content Mapping screen has three main sections:
1. **Parent Content Selector**: Choose which piece of parent content to map
2. **Relationship Visualization**: Interactive graph showing content connections
3. **Content Details**: Metrics and details about the selected content

### Creating Your First Content Family

To start mapping your content:

1. **Select Parent Content**:
   - From the dropdown menu, select the piece of content that was the original source (like a podcast episode or long-form video)
   - If your parent content isn't showing, click "+ Upload New Parent Content"

2. **Add Child Content**:
   - Click the "+ Add Child Content" button below the visualization
   - Select the platform where the derivative content lives
   - Choose the specific content piece or enter the URL
   - Select the relationship type (direct adaptation, clip, inspired by, etc.)
   - Click "Add Relationship"

3. **Review Visualization**:
   - The graph will update to show the parent-child relationship
   - You'll see lines connecting the related content pieces
   - Metrics will begin to aggregate across the family

### Working with AI-Suggested Relationships

Engagerr's AI can automatically detect potential content relationships based on:
- Content similarity
- Publishing timing
- Tags and descriptions
- Audience engagement patterns

When the AI finds potential relationships:

1. You'll see an "AI Suggestions" notification in your dashboard
2. In the Content Mapping section, look for content with a "Suggestions Available" badge
3. Review each suggestion by clicking on it
4. For each suggestion, you can:
   - **Approve**: Add this relationship to your content family
   - **Reject**: Indicate this is not a related piece of content
   - **Edit**: Modify the relationship type before approving

**Pro Tip**: The AI learns from your approvals and rejections, becoming more accurate over time.

### Understanding the Relationship Visualization

The visualization represents your content family as a hierarchical graph:

- **Parent Node**: The original content (typically longer form)
- **Child Nodes**: Direct derivatives of the parent content
- **Grandchild Nodes**: Content derived from the children
- **Connections**: Lines showing the relationships between content

Nodes are color-coded by platform (e.g., red for YouTube, purple for Instagram) and sized based on performance metrics.

You can:
- Hover over any node to see key metrics
- Click a node to select it and view detailed information
- Drag nodes to rearrange the visualization
- Use the zoom controls to focus on specific parts of large content families

### Advanced Mapping Features

For power users (Pro and Enterprise tiers):

- **Bulk Relationship Creation**: Import relationships from a CSV file
- **Custom Relationship Types**: Define relationship types specific to your content workflow
- **Relationship Tags**: Add descriptive tags to relationships for better organization
- **Manual Performance Adjustment**: Override system-calculated metrics when necessary

### Best Practices for Content Mapping

For the most accurate analytics:

1. **Start with Parent Content**: Always identify the original source material first
2. **Be Consistent**: Use the same approach to mapping across all your content
3. **Update Regularly**: Review and approve AI suggestions at least weekly
4. **Use Descriptive Names**: Give content clear names that make relationships obvious
5. **Don't Skip Platforms**: Connect all platforms where you publish for complete data

## Understanding Cross-Platform Analytics

Engagerr's analytics engine unifies data from all your platforms into a cohesive view.

### Accessing the Analytics Dashboard

| --- | --- | --- |
| Views | Combined views across platforms with duplication estimates | Shows total content reach |
| Engagements | Weighted combination of interactions (likes, comments, shares) | Indicates audience action |
