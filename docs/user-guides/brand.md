## Introduction to Engagerr

Welcome to Engagerr, the comprehensive platform revolutionizing how brands connect with content creators. In today's fragmented digital landscape, identifying the right creators, measuring true content value, and tracking ROI across platforms has been nearly impossible—until now.

Engagerr solves these fundamental challenges through its proprietary content relationship mapping technology, which tracks how content evolves and spreads across platforms. This innovation allows brands to:

- Discover creators based on verified, standardized performance metrics
- Understand true audience reach across platforms without duplication

2. Funds are held securely in escrow until deliverables are completed and approved
3. The creator submits deliverables through the platform
4. The brand reviews and approves the content
5. Upon approval, funds are released to the creator
6. For multi-milestone partnerships, the process repeats for each milestone

This system ensures creators know payment is secured before they begin work, while brands retain approval control before funds are released.

### Payment Methods and Fees

Engagerr supports these payment methods:

- ACH bank transfers (US only)
- Wire transfers (international)

**Fee Structure**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Account Management

**Q: How many team members can I add to my account?**
A: The number varies by subscription tier: Starter (2), Growth (5), and Enterprise (unlimited). Each team member can be assigned specific roles and permissions.

**Q: Can I have multiple brands under one account?**
A: Enterprise subscribers can manage multiple brand profiles under a parent account. Other tiers require separate accounts for distinct brands.

**Q: How do I update my company information?**
A: Navigate to "Profile" in the main menu to update your brand information, logo, and company details.

**Q: Can I transfer ownership of our brand account?**
A: Yes, account ownership can be transferred to another team member with admin privileges. Contact support for assistance with this process.

**Q: What happens to our partnerships if we downgrade our subscription?**
A: Active partnerships will continue until completion. If you exceed the partnership limit of your new tier, you won't be able to create new partnerships until you're under the limit.

### Creator Discovery

**Q: How are match scores calculated?**
A: Match scores use AI algorithms to evaluate compatibility based on audience alignment, content relevance, performance history, and brand affinity. Scores update dynamically as both brand and creator profiles evolve.

**Q: Can I search for creators by specific audience demographics?**
A: Yes, the advanced filters allow you to search by detailed demographic criteria including age ranges, locations, gender distribution, and interests.

**Q: How recent is the performance data for creators?**
A: Creator metrics are typically updated daily. The "Last Updated" timestamp on their profile indicates when their data was last refreshed.

**Q: Can I see which other brands a creator has worked with?**
A: Creators control the visibility of their past partnerships. Many showcase these in their portfolio, but some may keep certain collaborations private.

**Q: How do I know if a creator is available for partnerships?**
A: Creators indicate their availability status in their profile. Additionally, active creators typically respond to inquiries within 48 hours.

### Campaign Management

**Q: What's the difference between a campaign and a partnership?**
A: A campaign is a strategic initiative that can include multiple creator partnerships working toward a common goal. A partnership is a specific collaboration with an individual creator, which may be part of a campaign or standalone.

**Q: Can I move a partnership from one campaign to another?**
A: Yes, you can reassign partnerships between campaigns through the partnership details page by selecting "Move to Campaign."

**Q: How many creators can I include in a single campaign?**
A: There's no technical limit to the number of creators in a campaign, but practical management typically becomes challenging beyond 20-30 creators without an Enterprise subscription with advanced workflow tools.

**Q: Can creators see each other in my campaign?**
A: By default, creators cannot see who else is part of your campaign. You can enable "Creator Collaboration" in campaign settings if you want creators to be aware of and potentially collaborate with each other.

**Q: How do I share campaign results with stakeholders who don't have Engagerr accounts?**
A: You can generate shareable reports from the campaign analytics page that can be exported as PDFs or provided as secure links that don't require Engagerr login credentials.

### Partnership Management

**Q: How do I ensure creators follow our brand guidelines?**
A: Upload your brand guidelines in the campaign or partnership setup. Additionally, you can require pre-approval of content before publishing in your contract terms.

**Q: What happens if a creator doesn't deliver content on time?**
A: The platform automatically sends reminders as deadlines approach. If deadlines are missed, you can extend the timeline, renegotiate deliverables, or in serious cases, terminate the partnership per your contract terms.

**Q: Can I request revisions to submitted content?**
A: Yes, the review process allows you to request revisions with specific feedback. You can specify the number of revision rounds in your initial contract.

**Q: How does the payment protection work?**
A: Funds are held in secure escrow until you approve the creator's deliverables. This protects both parties—creators know payment is secured, and brands maintain quality control before release.

**Q: What if we need to cancel a partnership after signing?**
A: Cancellation terms should be defined in your contract. The platform supports early termination processes with proportional payment for completed work when appropriate.

### Analytics & Reporting

**Q: How does Engagerr track cross-platform performance?**
A: Engagerr's proprietary content relationship mapping technology tracks content across platforms, standardizes metrics from different sources, and provides deduplicated audience calculations.

**Q: Can I attribute conversions to specific creators?**
A: Yes, you can set up tracking links for each creator that integrate with your analytics tools. Additionally, Enterprise customers can access advanced attribution modeling.

**Q: How accurate are the audience demographics?**
A: Audience data comes directly from platform APIs with statistical modeling to fill gaps. Accuracy varies by platform but generally represents the best available information without requiring audience surveys.

**Q: Can I export raw data for custom analysis?**
A: Yes, all reports offer CSV export options for raw data. Enterprise customers also have access to API endpoints for programmatic data access.

**Q: How far back does historical data go?**
A: Standard accounts can access 12 months of historical data. Enterprise accounts can access up to 24 months and request archive restoration for older data.
