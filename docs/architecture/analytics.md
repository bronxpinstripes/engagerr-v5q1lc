# Engagerr Analytics Architecture

## 1. Introduction

The Analytics Engine is a core differentiator for Engagerr, enabling content creators to understand their true reach and impact across multiple platforms. Traditional analytics tools provide siloed views of performance on individual platforms, forcing creators to manually combine and interpret fragmented data. Engagerr's analytics system solves this fundamental problem by unifying metrics across platforms, standardizing different engagement definitions, and providing holistic insights through content relationship mapping.

### Purpose & Goals

The Engagerr Analytics system is designed to:

- Unify fragmented analytics from multiple social platforms into a cohesive view
- Track hierarchical content relationships to show the full lifecycle performance of content
- Standardize inconsistent metrics across platforms into comparable formats
- Calculate aggregated performance across content families
- Generate actionable insights based on cross-platform patterns
- Visualize complex analytics in intuitive, interactive formats

## 2. Architecture Overview

The Analytics Engine architecture implements a modular, pipeline-oriented approach to process raw platform data into standardized, aggregated metrics with relationship context.

    S1 --> C[Calculated Metrics]
    S2 --> C
    S3 --> C
    S4 --> C
    
    C --> D[Derived Metrics]
```

### 5.2. Platform-Specific Transformations

Each platform requires specific transformations to standardize metrics:

| Platform | Metric | Transformation | Standard Metric |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YouTube | Views | Direct mapping | Standard Views |
| YouTube | Watch time | Direct mapping (minutes) | Standard Watch Time |
| YouTube | Likes | Value × 1.0 (baseline) | Standard Engagements |
| YouTube | Comments | Value × 5.0 (weighted) | Standard Engagements |
| YouTube | Shares | Value × 10.0 (weighted) | Standard Shares |
| Instagram | Impressions | Value × 0.8 (reach adjustment) | Standard Views |
| Instagram | Video views | Direct mapping | Standard Views |
| Instagram | Hearts/Likes | Value × 0.9 (platform adjustment) | Standard Engagements |
| Instagram | Comments | Value × 4.5 (weighted) | Standard Engagements |
| Instagram | Saves | Value × 15.0 (weighted) | Standard Engagements |
| TikTok | Views | Direct mapping | Standard Views |
| TikTok | Video play time | Value ÷ 60 (seconds to minutes) | Standard Watch Time |
| TikTok | Likes | Value × 0.85 (platform adjustment) | Standard Engagements |
| TikTok | Comments | Value × 4.8 (weighted) | Standard Engagements |
| TikTok | Shares | Value × 12.0 (weighted) | Standard Shares |

These transformations are regularly calibrated based on platform changes and industry standards.

### 5.3. Derived Metrics Calculation

From standardized base metrics, the system calculates these key derived metrics:

- **View-Through Rate**: `(Completed Views / Total Views) × 100`
- **Average Watch Time**: `Standard Watch Time / Standard Views`
- **Share Rate**: `(Standard Shares / Standard Views) × 100`
- **Content Value**: Complex formula based on engagement, reach, and platform value coefficients
- **Performance Score**: Weighted score relative to creator's historical performance and industry benchmarks

### 5.4. Audience Deduplication

A critical component of cross-platform analytics is audience deduplication:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A1[Platform A Audience] --> C[Audience Overlap Engine]
    A2[Platform B Audience] --> C
    A3[Platform C Audience] --> C
    
    C --> D1[Demographic Matching]
    C --> D2[Platform Correlation]
    C --> D3[Behavioral Patterns]
    
    D1 --> E[Overlap Estimation Model]
    D2 --> E
    D3 --> E
    
    E --> F[Deduplicated Audience Metrics]
    F --> G[Total Unique Audience]
    F --> H[Platform-Specific Unique Audience]
    F --> I[Cross-Platform Audience]
```

Deduplication approaches include:
1. **Demographic Pattern Matching**: Statistical model of audience overlap based on demographics
2. **Platform-to-Platform Correlation**: Historical data on typical overlap between platforms
3. **Behavioral Pattern Analysis**: Engagement patterns suggesting the same users across platforms

| **Reaction** | User-generated response content | Engagement extension |
| **Reference** | Content that references without derivation | Influence tracking |

### 8.3. Technical Implementation

The relationship tracking is implemented using:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ContentNode {
        +id: string
        +creatorId: string
        +contentId: string
        +path: ltree
        +depth: integer
        +root_id: string
    }
    
    class ContentPath {
        +defineContentPath(contentId, parentId)
        +getContentTree(rootId)
        +getContentFamily(contentId)
        +getDescendants(contentId)
        +getAncestors(contentId)
    }
    
    class PathOperations {
        +addPathNode(contentId, parentPath)
        +removePathNode(contentId)
        +moveSubtree(contentId, newParentId)
        +findCommonAncestor(contentId1, contentId2)
    }
    
    ContentNode --> ContentPath
    ContentPath --> PathOperations
```

PostgreSQL's LTREE extension provides efficient storage and querying of hierarchical relationships:
