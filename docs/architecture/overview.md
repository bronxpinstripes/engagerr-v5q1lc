## Engagerr Platform Architecture Overview

### Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Engagerr platform's technical architecture. It introduces the core design decisions, system components, and how different parts interact to create a cohesive system.

#### Platform Purpose

Engagerr is a two-sided marketplace connecting content creators and brands through data-driven insights and relationship mapping.

#### Business Context

The architecture is designed to address the core business problems of fragmented creator analytics and inefficient brand partnership processes, meeting the needs of content creators, brands, and marketing agencies.

#### Key Technical Differentiators

Engagerr differentiates itself through proprietary content mapping technology, cross-platform analytics standardization, and AI-driven insights.

### Architectural Overview

This section provides a high-level description of Engagerr's architecture, including key components, interactions, and design decisions.

#### Architecture Principles

The architecture is guided by the following core principles:

- **API-First Design**: All functionality is exposed through well-defined API routes.
- **Server & Client Components**: Strategic use of React Server Components for data-intensive operations and Client Components for interactive elements.
- **Modular Monolithic Approach**: Functional service components are used within a unified application.
